This game was made by [BlueSheep3](https://github.com/BlueSheep3) and [Per](https://github.com/Per6) for the [GMTK Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024).

The jam's theme was "Built to Scale".\
In software development the term "scalable" is often used to refer to something that can easily be extended / built on top of, so this game is about building a large Tower, which requires you to design it in a scalable way.

For a detailed list of all external assets we used, see [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md).
